## Projects

- [**Obesity level prediction based on lifestyle using k-nn**](dsci_100) </br>
  Group project for DSCI 100, Introduction to Data Science. We correctly predicted obesity levels at a rate of 72%, using physical activity frequency, water intake, daily technology usage and weight. </br>
  
- [**Testing the difference in crime rates in Kitsilano and Hastings-Sunrise**](stat_201)</br>
  Group project for STAT 201, Introduction to Statistical Inference. We found that there is a significant difference in crime rates between the two neighbourhoods using hypothesis testing at a 95% confidence level. </br>
  
  
- [**Predicting death following a heart failure**](stat_306) </br>
  Group project for STAT 306, Finding Relationships in Data. Using logistic regression and variable selection based on AIC and BIC, we correctly predicted the death of patients following a heart failure with 86.7% correct prediction rate.
